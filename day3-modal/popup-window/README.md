# Modal/Popup Window Project

This project demonstrates how to create a simple modal (popup window) and control its visibility using both `classList.toggle()` and the element's `style.display` property.

## Features

- Open and close a modal window.
- Two approaches: toggling a CSS class and toggling the `display` style directly.
- Simple and clean UI.

## How It Works

- The modal is hidden by default.
- Clicking the "Open Modal" button or the close icon calls a function to toggle the modal's visibility.
- You can use either `classList.toggle()` to add or remove a CSS class that controls display, or directly set the `style.display` property in JavaScript.

## Customization

- Style the modal and overlay as needed.
- Add more content or animations for a better user experience.
